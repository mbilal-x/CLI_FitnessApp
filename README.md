## Introduction

This repository contains the Fitness Application, a command-line interface (CLI) program developed as a part of my 1st-semester Programming Fundamentals course during my BCS studies in 2020. The purpose of this project was to create an interactive fitness application where users can create an account, set fitness goals, and receive personalized workout plans based on their goals and performance in a push-up test.

The application is entirely built using C++ programming language, providing an easy-to-navigate and user-friendly experience for individuals looking to improve their fitness journey.

## Features

- User account creation and management
- Setting fitness goals based on preferences (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, general fitness)
- Customized workout plans tailored to individual goals
- Performance test for push-ups to gauge fitness level
- Easy-to-use CLI interface for a seamless user experience
